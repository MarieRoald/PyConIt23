# Peer instructions
## Instructions
There are three multiple-choice exercises below, and you will attempt to answer each of them twice:

 * First, try to answer every question by yourself and mark you answer in the *Before discussion* column.
 * Then, pair up with a partner and discuss which alternative you think is correct and why. Mark which answer you think is correct after the discussion in the *After discussion* column.

## Exercise 1

```python
n = 5

def compute_average(data):
    n = len(data)
    s = sum(data)
    return s / n

compute_average([2, 2, 2])
print(n)
```

| Alternatives        | Attempt 1 | Attempt 2 |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| `3`                 | ▢         | ▢         |
| `5`                 | ▢         | ▢         |
| `NameError`         | ▢         | ▢         |
| `2`                 | ▢         | ▢         |


## Exercise 2

```python
def compute_average(data):
    n = len(data)
    s = sum(data)
    return s / n

data = [1, 1, 1]
print(compute_average([2, 2, 2]))
```

| Alternatives        | Attempt 1 | Attempt 2 |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| `2`                 | ▢         | ▢         |
| `SyntaxError`       | ▢         | ▢         |
| `UnboundLocalError` | ▢         | ▢         |
| `1`                 | ▢         | ▢         |



## Exercise 3

```python
def compute_average(d):
    n = len(data)
    s = sum(data)
    return s / n

data = [1, 1, 1]
print(compute_average([2, 2, 2]))
```

| Alternatives        | Attempt 1 | Attempt 2 |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| `1`                 | ▢         | ▢         |
| `NameError`         | ▢         | ▢         |
| `2`                 | ▢         | ▢         |
| `UnboundLocalError` | ▢         | ▢         |
